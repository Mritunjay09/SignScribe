## System Architecture

The SignScribe application follows a client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend components.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture. Key architectural elements include:

- **Component Structure**: Organized into reusable UI components, pages, and feature-specific components
- **Routing**: Handled by React Router for navigation between different sections
- **State Management**: Combination of React Context for global state and local state for component-specific data
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracted common functionality like authentication into reusable hooks

### Backend Architecture

The backend utilizes Express.js running on Node.js with the following architecture:

- **RESTful API**: Structured endpoints for handling various client requests
- **Middleware**: For authentication, request validation, and error handling
- **Database Layer**: Postgres interface for data persistence
- **Security Layer**: Implementation of authentication, authorization, and data validation

### Code Sample: Authentication Context Provider

```typescript
// src/hooks/useAuth.tsx
import { useState, useEffect, createContext, useContext, ReactNode } from 'react';
import { 
  User, 
  fetchUserProfile, 
  isAuthenticated as checkAuth, 
  logout as signOut,
  refreshAuthToken,
  hasRole as checkRole
} from '@/utils/authUtils';

// Create a context for auth state
interface AuthContextType {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  refreshUser: () => Promise<void>;
  hasRole: (role: string) => boolean;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType>({
  user: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  isLoading: true,
  logout: async () => {},
  refreshUser: async () => {},
  hasRole: () => false,
});

// Provider component
export const AuthProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  
  const refreshUser = async () => {
    if (checkAuth()) {
      try {
        const userData = await fetchUserProfile();
        setUser(userData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch user data:', error);
        // Try to refresh the token
        const refreshed = await refreshAuthToken();
        if (refreshed) {
          // Try fetching user data again with the new token
          try {
            const userData = await fetchUserProfile();
            setUser(userData);
          } catch (secondError) {
            console.error('Failed to fetch user data after token refresh:', secondError);
            setUser(null);
          }
        } else {
          setUser(null);
        }
      }
    } else {
      setUser(null);
    }
  };
  
  const logout = async () => {
    await signOut();
    setUser(null);
  };
  
  const hasRole = (role: string) => {
    return checkRole(role);
  };
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const initialize = async () => {
      setIsLoading(true);
      await refreshUser();
      setIsLoading(false);
    };
    
    initialize();
    
    // Set up token refresh interval
    const refreshInterval = setInterval(async () => {
      if (checkAuth()) {
        await refreshAuthToken();
      }
    }, 10 * 60 * 1000); // Refresh token every 10 minutes
    
    return () => clearInterval(refreshInterval);
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider
      value={{
        user,
        isAuthenticated: !!user,
        isLoading,
        logout,
        refreshUser,
        hasRole
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

// Hook to use the auth context
export const useAuth = () => useContext(AuthContext);
```

## Key Features and Implementation

### User Authentication System

SignScribe implements a comprehensive authentication system with the following features:

- Email and password authentication
- JWT-based token authentication with refresh tokens
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook)
- Password reset functionality
- Account locking after failed login attempts
- Session management

### Code Sample: Login Implementation

```typescript
// backend/src/server.ts (partial)
app.post('/login', authRateLimiter, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  try {
    const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', [email]);
    if (result.rows.length === 0) {
       res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
       return;
    }

    const user = result.rows[0];

    if (user.lock_until && new Date(user.lock_until) > new Date()) {
      const lockTimeRemaining = Math.ceil(
        (new Date(user.lock_until).getTime() - new Date().getTime()) / 60000
      );
      res.status(403).json({
        message: `Account is locked. Try again in ${lockTimeRemaining} minutes.`,
      });
      return;
    }

    const isPasswordValid = await comparePassword(password, user.password);
    if (!isPasswordValid) {
      const failedAttempts = user.failed_login_attempts + 1;
      let lockUntil = null;

      if (failedAttempts >= config.security.maxLoginAttempts) {
        lockUntil = new Date(Date.now() + config.security.lockTime);
      }

      await pool.query(
        'UPDATE users SET failed_login_attempts = $1, lock_until = $2 WHERE id = $3',
        [failedAttempts, lockUntil, user.id]
      );

      res.status(401).json({
        message: 'Invalid credentials',
        attemptsLeft: config.security.maxLoginAttempts - failedAttempts,
      });
      return;
    }

    await pool.query(
      'UPDATE users SET failed_login_attempts = 0, lock_until = NULL, last_login = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = $1',
      [user.id]
    );

    const token = await generateAccessToken(user);
    const refreshToken = await generateRefreshToken(user);

    await pool.query('UPDATE users SET refresh_token = $1 WHERE id = $2', [refreshToken, user.id]);

    res.status(200).json({
      user: sanitizeUser(user),
      token,
      refreshToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

const requestCounts = new Map<string, number[]>();
const RATE_LIMIT = config.security.maxRequestsPerMinute || 100;
const WINDOW_MS = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute

const rateLimiter = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction): void => {
  const ip = req.ip as string;
  const now = Date.now();
  const windowStart = now - WINDOW_MS;

  const requestTimes = requestCounts.get(ip) || [];
  const recentRequests = requestTimes.filter((time) => time > windowStart);

  if (recentRequests.length >= RATE_LIMIT) {
    res.status(429).json({ message: 'Too many requests. Please try again later.' });
    return;
  }

  recentRequests.push(now);
  requestCounts.set(ip, recentRequests);

  // Cleanup old IPs (run periodically)
  if (requestCounts.size > 1000) {
    for (const [key, times] of requestCounts) {
      if (times.every((time) => now - time > WINDOW_MS)) {
        requestCounts.delete(key);
      }
    }
  }

  next();
};
```
